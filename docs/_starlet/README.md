Since ChatGPT launched on November 20, 2022, it has captured the imagination of humankind, becoming the [fastest-growing app in the history of the universe](https://www.zdnet.com/article/chatgpt-just-became-the-fastest-growing-app-of-all-time/) (outpacing even TikTok/Douyin) and never letting go.

Unsurprisingly, an ecosystem of tools that either utilize or enhance the AI's astounding power has blossomed.

**[chatgpt.js](https://chatgpt.js.org)** is a JavaScript library that supports this ecosystem by allowing for super-easy interaction w/ the ChatGPT DOM.

For example:

```js
chatgpt.getLastResponse();
chatgpt.getLastReply();
chatgpt.response.getLast();
chatgpt.get('reply', 'last');
```

Each call equally fetches the last response (from either DOM or API, dependent on script environment.)

Importing the library is equally simplistic:

```js
(async () => {
     await import('https://code.chatgptjs.org/chatgpt-latest.min.js');
    // Your code here...
})();
```

## Star growth

**chatgpt.js** is still a very young lib, but as shown by the Star History chart, it had a stunning growth period during a span of mere weeks:

Two main events can be attributed with causing this astonishing growth spurt:

- In June 2023, editors at Product Hunt [featured](https://www.producthunt.com/products/chatgpt-js#chatgpt-js) **chatgpt.js** on its front page, resulting in 100+ upvotes & thousands of unique visitors in the following days
